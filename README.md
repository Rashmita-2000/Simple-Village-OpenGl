# Simple-Village using OpenGl

This project intends to give an animated look of a simple village. The project includes both day and night view. Each view consists of its own components. The user is allowed to provide inputs through key board and mouse and view changes accordingly. 
Initially a scene in day view is displayed with two houses, sun, moving cloud, pond with fishes inside is displayed to the user. On keying ‘x’ or ‘y’ the fishes get repositioned (translated) along x and y axes respectively. When ‘r’ key is pressed, the fishes rotate through 360 degrees. When ‘n’ key is pressed, Night mode can be visualized.
When the options ‘Open doors’ and ‘Turn Lights ON’ are chosen from the menu on right click of the mouse, then mouse event occurs which performs the appropriate actions as desired by the user. 
In both night and day views, the clouds are in continuous movement due to the idle function that is implemented elsewhere and called in the main function.
